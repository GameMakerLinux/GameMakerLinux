# Game Maker Linux

An attempt to have a Game Maker IDE on Linux.

## What is working?

* Opening a project
* Editing scripts
* Editing events scripts
* Drag-and-Drop of resources in the tree view

## TODO

* Add key names
* Add events to objects
* Delete events from objects
* Change events types
* Save the reordering of the resources tree
* Everything else...

## Things that will never be done

* Drag-and-Drop scripts
* Compilation (or maybe the same way GM:S do it for linux)
* Fonts
* Probably other things
